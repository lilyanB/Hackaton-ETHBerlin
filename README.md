# ETHBerlin - Circular Merch Dapp project ðŸ‘šðŸ‘”ðŸ‘•ðŸ‘–

September 16-18, 2022


Circular Merch is a decentralized marketplace for buying and selling crypto merchandise between individuals.
We serve four needs in the web3:

1. Sustainability: giving a second life to what we no longer wear
2. Usefulness: engage the community and avoid excess merchandise at home
3. Privacy: send and receive an item without revealing your personal information
4. Transparency: share your article on Lens and create a reputation according to the score on our dapp.
